# grc_engineering_python_fundamentals

Python fundamentals learned through GRC Engineering problems. Every exercise uses compliance data — controls, findings, evidence records, and framework mappings — instead of generic examples.

## What This Is

A complete set of Python exercises paralleling [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition) by Eric Matthes, recontextualized for GRC Engineering. The concepts are identical (variables, lists, dictionaries, functions, classes, files, testing). The data is NIST 800-53, FedRAMP High, and CJIS v6.0.

Chapters 1–11 cover fundamentals. Chapters 12–20 replace the book's projects (Alien Invasion, data visualization, Django web app) with three GRC-relevant builds:

- **Project 1:** GRC Audit CLI Tool (Chapters 12–14)
- **Project 2:** Compliance Data Analysis (Chapters 15–17)
- **Project 3:** Compliance API with Flask (Chapters 18–20)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the exercise reference: [`grc_python_crash_course.md`](grc_python_crash_course.md)
3. Start with Chapter 1 — each exercise file has a docstring describing what to build
4. Read the full requirements in `grc_python_crash_course.md` before writing your solution

### Using Claude Code as a Tutor

The [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) file configures Claude Code as a Python tutor that reviews your work, runs your code, and gives hints — but never writes solutions. If you use Claude Code, it will follow these rules automatically.

### Recommended Git Workflow

Create a branch per chapter:
```
git checkout -b ch02-variables
```

Commit after each exercise:
```
git add exercises/ch02/exercise_2_1.py
git commit -m "feat(ch02): complete exercise 2-1 control variables"
```

Merge to main when a chapter is complete:
```
git checkout main
git merge ch02-variables
git branch -d ch02-variables
```

## Frameworks Referenced

- **NIST 800-53 Rev 5** — control IDs, families, and baselines used throughout all exercises
- **FedRAMP High** — baseline selection, evidence collection, and continuous monitoring exercises
- **CJIS v6.0** — MFA validation, FIPS 140-3 encryption checks, and CJI access controls
